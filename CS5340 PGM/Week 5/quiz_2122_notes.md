### problem 1
aleatoric uncertainty: natural randomness in the process. A parameter's value can change with each trial. (the variabiliy is random) 偶然不确定性，数据集，不可避免
epistemic uncertainty: uncertainty due to lack of knowledge in the model. (A parameter takes on a certain value but we're not sure what that value is) 知识不确定性，模型，可避免

### problem 2
E(aX)=aE(X), Var(aX)=a^2Var(X)
V(X+Y)=V(X)+V(Y)+2Cov(X,Y)
Cov(X,Y)=E(XY)-E(X)E(Y)=E(X-E(X))(Y-E(Y))

### problem 6
If the number of edges in two graphs are different, then it's not possible to re-write the probability distribution.

### problem 10
G \in P

### problem 11
1.tail to tail
A -> B 
  -> C
B \indepedent C | A
B not \indepedent C | null

2.head to tail
A -> B -> C
A \indepedent C | B
A not \indepedent C | null

3.head to head
A -> C
B -> 
A \indepedent B | null
A not \indepedent B | C
