# NUS Graduate Course Materials

Welcome to NUS graduate course materials repository! Here, you'll find slides and materials from various computer science courses. While primarily focused on courses I personally attended, this repository also includes contributions from anonymous friends and @OrionStar25.

This repository is for educational purposes, and also for memorializing my graduate school days in Singapore, though most of my time was spent on working on my graduation thesis and internships.

I hope this repository can help you to learn more about the courses and the professors at NUS without choosing the courses or attending the graduate school. And also welcome to contribute to this repository if you have any course materials to share or course comments to add.
